# Signal Query Models

**Signal Query Models** is a cutting-edge library designed to seamlessly integrate reactive model handling with the powerful data fetching and caching capabilities of React Query. Leveraging signals for fine-grained reactivity, this library aims to simplify state management and synchronization in React applications, making it easier for developers to build dynamic, responsive, and highly interactive user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Model Binding:** Utilizes signals to create reactive data models that automatically update the UI upon data changes.
- **Seamless Integration with React Query:** Enhances data fetching, caching, and synchronization strategies, providing a robust solution for managing server-state in React apps.
- **Simplified State Management:** Offers an intuitive and declarative approach to handle application state, reducing boilerplate and improving code readability.
- **Modular and Extensible:** Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and customization to fit various use cases.

## Current Status: In Development
